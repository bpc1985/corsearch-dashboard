# Corsearch Dashboard

A simple dashboard displays a list of users fetched from a REST API and allows the user to filter and sort the list. The application is built using React, TypeScript, SCSS and SASS with functional components and hooks

This web app does not use any extra third-party libraries to support its simplicity.
